#Welcome to pathway-displayer.js documentation

# Introduction

pathway-displayer.js is a javascript library to display multiple pathways and show
the relationship between them.

I started this project for my Final Degree Project (hosted in mpalign.uib.es) and later,
 in order to be used easily in other projects I made this library.

It's written in CoffeeScript using the paper.js library. It includes
a complete django example that downloads directly the pathways from KEGG and
a few easy examples to see how it works in each case.

# Download
In order to get the latest version: git clone https://github.com/rafelbennasar/pathway-displayer.git

# Features
- The library allows you to draw one or more pathways in the same canvas (actually,
as many as you want).
- It selects automatically the best zoom to fit all pathways in the screen.
- You can link reactions between all pathways without any limitation and set different colours.
- Virtual compounds/ reactions: In order to maintain a cleaner canvas if there are two or more compounds
together, they are groupped and it's created a new "virtual compound". Later,
the reactions between compounds from the same group are also minimized (in the same way how KEGG does it).



# TODO
1. Allow multple layouts when there's more than 2 pathways: inline, pile,
squares, etc.
2. Compounds still cannot be moved (and maybe will never do).


# Known bugs
1. If there are more than two pathways and one reaction from pathway A
is aligned with two or more reactions from different pathways,
may only be highlighted the reaction from the last pathway.
